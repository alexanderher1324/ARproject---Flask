# ARproject Flask App ðŸš€

A Flask-based social media scheduler web app that allows users to:

âœ… Register / Login with email and password confirmation
âœ… Connect Instagram or TikTok accounts
âœ… Schedule posts for either platform
âœ… View past posts
âœ… Secure CSRF-protected login/logout flow
âœ… Background scheduler for automated posting

---

## Project Structure

- `BD.py`: Application entry point configuring Flask, database, CSRF, and the auth blueprint.
- `auth.py`: Handles registration, login, and logout routes using a Flask blueprint.
- `models.py`: SQLAlchemy models including the `User` model for storing credentials.
- `UI/`: HTML templates rendered by Flask.
- `static/`: Static assets such as stylesheets.

## Usage

1. Create and activate a Python 3 virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Set environment variables inside `.env` (the application loads this file automatically and will fall back to `.env.example` if needed):
   - `SECRET_KEY` â€“ **required** secret key for Flask sessions. The app exits if this is not provided.
   - `DATABASE_URL` â€“ (optional) SQLAlchemy connection string. Defaults to SQLite `app.db`.
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python BD.py
   ```
5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Updating the database schema

If you add fields to models in `models.py` after the initial `app.db` has been
created, the existing SQLite database will not automatically pick up the new
columns. In that case delete `app.db` and let the application recreate it at
startup:

```bash
rm app.db
python BD.py  # creates a fresh database with the new columns
```

For production setups you would normally use a migration tool such as
[Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/) instead of deleting the
database.

The dashboard and authentication pages are under the `UI` folder.
